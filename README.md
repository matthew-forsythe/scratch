# A scratch repo on GitHub.com
This is a test of the new information added into the Git Repository

# Pull Request
The pull request feature did not work as I have no collaborating  
authors, so I will not be commenting in this markdown cell anymore.

# Pull Request Test 2
I was wrong, pull requests are done between branhes.  
I will not attempt to pull branch-1 into the master  
branch.

# Visual Code instead of Git Bash
Attempting to use VS Code and git desktop instead of git bash.  
Why do I suck at typing as of late???  
Note to self, markdown requries 2 spaces to jump to the  
next line.

I just made changes  
Is this working yet, yes it is.  
However I just updated again to fix the spacing.  
Final Test.  
I lied, because now I am testing the Local Certificate Change.  
This was succesfull and everything now seems to be working.

Testing the git add
